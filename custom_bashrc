# This turns the output of the command-not-found package into a prompt instead
# of telling the user to type out the command. So instead of this:
#
# > The program 'ccsm' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
# > sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
#
# you get this:
#
# > The program 'ccsm' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
# > sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
# > Do you want to install it? (N/y)
